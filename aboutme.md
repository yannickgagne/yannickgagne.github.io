My name is Yannick Gagne, I'm 41yo and a maker/tinkerer for quite some time. I learned so much from reading blogs, forums and watching videos that I decided to share back with whoever might end up on this site.

### My story

I was born and raised in a town called Baie-Comeau, located in the north of Québec. Love this part of the province but work opportunities recently made me move to Montréal. I have a wife and four awesome kids. We are slowly settling in this new city and lifestyle.

It was easy for me to understand computer stuff since a very young age so I decided to get a diploma in that field and quickly found a job afterward. So that's about 20 years working with computers, networking, microcontrollers, coding, etc.  I don't consider myself
an expert in everything but I sure have a good eye and the mindset to search and destroy bugs!
