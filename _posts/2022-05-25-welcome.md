Welcome to Maker's Inn, my shiny new web site where I plan to write articles on my many interests. You'll find a variety of topics like electronics, gardening, programming, 3D printing. There's just so many things I find interesting and want to share.

The idea behind this site is that I learn so much from other sites that I wanted to share back and also put my own twist on some topics.

The name, Maker's Inn, comes from the image in my head where people from any level of knowledge and experience can sit together and share ideas or dreams and possibly collaborate to make them happen.

You'll also see the subtitle "Knowledge, Sharing, Kindness, Respect", those things are important to me and will be a form of guideline for this site. Anyone is welcomed here if you remember this.

Thanks for reading! ;-)
